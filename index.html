It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school. It has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditioned but has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC system does not work.</p>

      </h5>
		  <p>One could actually see the future leaders in the contestants. The decisions of the judges were final. There were no foul plays. This year our school won the first prize and much to our amazement two of the best speakers were from our school.

All the participants were students with equal calibre and potential but in the end, some stood out shining brighter than the others. The topic for the final competition was " the increasing number of old age homes in India ". There were so many notable points presented by each team but the point presented by the winning team was the game-changer.</p>
